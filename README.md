# This project create a real time app for facial recognition 

## How to use
  1.1 If you already have your facial image, put it in ImageRaw Folder then run Image_process.py or face_detector.py for reprocess your raw image to image that fit requirements<br />
  1.2 If you dont have your facial image, you can put your ID_card image in ID_image then run crop_personal_img.py which will crop your facial image in ID card and put it in ImageRaw Folder<br />
  2. Push manual some information from ID card to Firebase server through AddDataToDatabase.py<br />
